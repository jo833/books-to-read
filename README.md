# books-to-read

In this repository, I will be using a csv that came from a list of books from The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/01/top-100-books-of-all-time). From there they will be sorted using a binary search tree and the user will be allowed to delete and add to the list.
